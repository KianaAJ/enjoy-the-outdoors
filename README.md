### Interesting Code Snippet

This code was the most interesting to me because it was fun to work on and I feel like I was able to self-diagnose the errors I had and fix them on my own and it helped me understand arrays, loops, and objects even more. Plus, inner HTML is a life saver and this was probably the easiest code I had to read!

function displayParkCard (event) {
    const chosenLocation = event.target.value
    let html =""
    for (const currentPark of nationalParks) {
        if (currentPark.State === chosenLocation) {
            console.log("matching state:", currentPark)
            html += `
            <div class="card text-white bg-success mb-3">
            <div class="card-body">
                <img src="" class="card-img-top" id="mtnImage">
                <h4 class="card-header">${currentPark.LocationName}</h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                <li>Address: ${currentPark.Address}
                <li>City: ${currentPark.City}
                <li>State: ${currentPark.State}
                 <li>Zip Code: ${currentPark.ZipCode} 
                 <li>Phone Number: ${currentPark.Phone}
                 <li>Fax Number: ${currentPark.Fax}
                 <li>Coordinates: ${currentPark.Location.coordinates}
                 <li>Type: ${currentPark.Location.type}
                 <li><a href="${currentPark.Visit}">Visit Park</a>
                </p>
                </div>
            </div> 
            `
        }
    }
    const resultsElement = document.getElementById("matching-parks")
    resultsElement.innerHTML = html
}
